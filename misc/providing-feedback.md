Please intend to help your fellow programmers improve.  There is a [time](http://proco.stanford.edu/) and [place](https://www.codewars.com/) for competition, it's not here.

## Tips

Here's a collection on easy-to-digest bits; pick one at random for inspiration in leaving constructive feedback on submissions:

- Make your feedback more digestible: start by pointing out something you really liked about this submission.
- Imagine this person is you when you first started in the language.
- With each challenge, include a piece of support.
- What if you framed your feedback as a question to encourage curiosity, rather than a correcting directive?
- Consider leaving a praise-only comment on this one.
- Imagine you're warmly welcoming someone to your country when introducing them to the idioms and ways-of-thinking of the language.
- Empathize: is your feedback worded in a way that you could easily take?
